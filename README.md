Select an uncensor for your character in the character maker in the Body/General tab or specify a default uncensor to use in the plugin settings. The default uncensor will apply to any character that does not have one selected.<br/>

Requirements:
* Marco's [KKAPI](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/KKAPI/releases)
* Marco's [Overlay Mods](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/Koikatu-Overlay-Mods/releases)
* [BepisPlugins](https://github.com/bbepis/BepisPlugins/releases) ExtensibleSaveFormat and Sideloader.

For makers of uncensors, see the [template](https://github.com/IllusionMods/KK_Plugins/blob/master/src/UncensorSelector.Core/Template.xml) for how to configure your uncensor for UncensorSelector compatibility.<br/>

Make sure to remove any sideloader uncensors and replace your oo_base with a clean, unmodified one to prevent incompatibilities!<br/>

#### MaterialEditor
**v3.1 - [Download](https://github.com/IllusionMods/KK_Plugins/releases/v199/)** - For Koikatsu, EmotionCreators, AI Girl, Honey Select 2, and Play Home<br/>

MaterialEditor is a plugin that allows you to edit many properties of objects that aren't usually accessible in game. Much like [Marco's clothing overlays](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/Koikatu-Overlay-Mods) you can replace the texture of an item, however with MaterialEditor you can edit much more than clothes. Edit clothes, accessories, hair, and even Studio items.

Features:
* Export UV maps of a mesh to help with drawing textures
* Replace nearly any texture with custom textures
* Change properties of materials to control things like shininess or outline thickness
* Change properties of the mesh to affect whether it casts shadows or disable a mesh completely
* Change the shader of a material
* All changes save and load with the card or Studio scene
* Duplicate textures are saved to the card once. 100 accessories with the same texture have the same file size as one accessory with a texture

Access the Material Editor by pressing the "Open Material Editor" button on clothes, hair, or accessories in the character maker. Access it in Studio by pressing the "Mat. Editor" button on the Workspace with a studio item selected.
